  *   This is where all of the "COMPONENTS" stylesheets are compiled
  *
  *   The Components layer is where we begin to style recognisable pieces of UI.
  *   We're still binding onto classes here, so our specificity hasn't yet increased.
  *   However, this layer is more explicit than the last one in that we are now styling explicit, designed pieces of the DOM.
  *   We shouldn't find any selectors with a lower specificity than one class in this layer.
  *   This is where the majority of your work will happen after initial project set-up.
  *   Adding new components and features usually makes up the vast majority of development.
